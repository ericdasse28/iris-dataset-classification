# iris-dataset-classification
The Iris dataset, also called *Fisher's Iris Dataset* or *Anderson's Iris Dataset*, is a one of (if not) the most known dataset in the pattern recognition literature. Each entry contains morphologic information about different instances of an iris flower as well as the corresponding species of iris that corresponds to it. The set of possible species comprises _Iris Setosa_, _Iris Versicolor_ and _Iris Virginica. From that dataset, the machine learning task performed in this repository is to create a model able to determine the species of an iris flower given these morphological information
